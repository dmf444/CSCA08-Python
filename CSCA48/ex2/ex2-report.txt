1) Testing with a valid possible move set with the "Middle Out Algorithm" as a
Container :-)                                                                         .. ok!
2) Testing with a valid possible move set with a BlackHole!!11 (Possible since the
Container does not need to be used)..                                                 .. ok!
3) Testing with a valid possible move set with a Bucket..                             .. ok!
4) Testing with a valid but impossible move set with a BlackHole!!11 (All get/peek
calls fail)..                                                                         .. ok!
5) Testing with a valid possible move set with a Stack..                              .. ok!
6) Testing with a valid but impossible (since the Result word contains non-
existent letters) move set..                                                          .. ok!
7) Testing with a valid possible move set with a Queue..                              .. ok!
